<h1>About PetPicks</h1>
<p>
    PetPicks is a community engagement platform designed for pet owners who enjoy fun and friendly competitions.
    Users can upload a photo of their pet and enter active lottery rounds for a chance to win digital achievement
    badges.
</p>

<p>
    Each lottery round is managed by an administrator to ensure fairness and transparency.
    Only approved entries are included in the draw, and winners are selected randomly.

    PetPicks focuses on creativity, community participation, and positive engagement.
    No monetary rewards are involved - winners receive digital badges as recognition.
